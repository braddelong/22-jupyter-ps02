    "Moreover, over the next several thousand years there was definitely a two-heads-are-better-than-one phenomenon as more people applying their brains and communicating with each other further increased the rate of growth. We saw a further doubling of the proportional pace of growth of the human useful ideas stock with the coming of cities (and their power to dominate and concentrate resources), record-keeping, and reading 5000 years ago. We saw a further doubling 3000 years ago, with the coming of civilization: what some call the “axial age”.\n",
    "\n",
    "But then, after about the year one (probably better-dated to 150) according to the most-used current calendar, the proportional growth rate of the ideas stock dropped. Before the year one, we could say that humanity, considered as a time-binding anthology intelligence, was undergoing super-exponential growth in its knowledge and capabilities. After the year one—or 150–that was no longer true. We can see this arrival of the mid-first millennium Eurasian dark age—the late-antiquity pause—as a second watershed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, starting around 1500, we see three more watersheds:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The coming of the commercial revolution era and the knitting together economically of the entire world via ocean transport produced a renewed worldwide acceleration in the proportional pace of ideas-stock growth: roughly a quadrupling, to rates of growth that had never been seen outside of areas in the Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, or north China that were relatively small portions of the globe. \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) 1770 saw the coming of the industrial revolution era, at first very highly concentrated in the northwestern tip of Eurasian continent: it more than tripled the proportional rate of ideas stock growth from its already unprecedentedly high level. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Then, about a century later, with the coming (a) of full globalization as we know it, (b) of the industrial research lab to rationalize and routinize the creation and development of technologies, and (c) of the modern corporation to rationalize and routinize their global deployment, came the era of modern economic growth that we live in. Since 1870 or so, the proportional growth rate of the human ideas stock has not been the 0.035% per year of the first millennium and a half, or the 0.15% per year of the commercial revolution era, or even the 0.45% per year of the 1770 to 1870 industrial revolution era. It has, rather, been more than four times as great as even this last: more than 2% per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the \"innovation\" part of very long-run human economic history since the invention of agriculture. How about the \"fecundity and demography\" part? And the \"resources\" part?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a fact that the typical human of 1500 lived little or no better than the typical human of -3000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Atypical humans, of course, lived much better in 1500: Gilgamesh, King of Uruk in -3000, may or may not have been absolute master of thousands, but for him the consumption goods at his disposal we’re little more than bread and meat for nourishment, fleeces and simple textiles to lie on for comfort, and beer for amusement-Even to obtain cedarwood required, for Gilgamesh, a significant military expedition and struggle. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the typical human standard of living was set by Malthusian pressure: People sought to increase their numbers over the generations. But slow growth of technology limited the long run rate of population increase to perhaps twice the slow rate of ideas stock growth. What was the mechanism? Limited resources. Because of limited resources, more mouths meant each had to be fed off of a smaller plot of land. Even though each mouth comes with two hands, average productivity fell. That fall continued until nutrition was poor enough that disease and famine carried enough people away to limit population growth to the Malthusian warranted rate. That kept the bulk of humanity poor: a standard of living equivalent, roughly, to what the World Bank today would call $2.50 a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the growth acceleration of the commercial revolution 1500 to 1770, technology begin to gain a few steps on fecundity—the potato and maize-corn were big players here. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the 1770 to 1870 industrial revolution saw more. The world in 1870 had a previously-unimaginable 1.3 billion people. They livedf at a typical standard of not 2.50 but perhaps 4 a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it is the post-1870 modern economic growth that has seen the real explosion of wealth. And it has been coupled with the demographic transition. Humanity has decided it is rich enough to be able to afford to and to desire to restrict its fertility. So we now approach zero population growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have almost 50 times as many people on the earth living almost 15 times as well as we had back in the year one.\n",
